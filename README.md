# How Does One Use This?

## What Does This Do?

A booted ops-manager plus a whole BOATLOAD of other goodies, including:

- Friendly DNS entries brought to you by Route53
- An RDS
- A VPC, with security groups
- A whole mess of s3 buckets (5 in total - for all your storage needs)
- An amazing NAT Box
- SSH/HTTPS/TCP ELBs
- An IAM User

## Looking to setup a different IAAS

We have have other terraform templates to help you!

- [azure](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/terraforming-azure)
- [gcp](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/terraforming-gcp)

This list will be updated when more infrastructures come along.

## Prerequisites

```bash
brew update
brew install terraform
```

### AWS Permissions
- AmazonEC2FullAccess
- AmazonRDSFullAccess
- AmazonRoute53FullAccess
- AmazonS3FullAccess
- AmazonVPCFullAccess
- IAMFullAccess

## Notes

You can choose whether you would like an RDS or not. By default we have
`rds_instance_count` set to `0` but setting it to 1 will deploy an RDS.

RDS instances take FOREVER to deploy, keep that in mind.

### Var File

Copy the stub content below into a file called `terraform.tfvars` and put it in the root of this project.
These vars will be used when you run `terraform  apply`.
You should fill in the stub values with the correct content.

```hcl
env_name           = "some-environment-name"
access_key         = "access-key-id"
secret_key         = "secret-access-key"
region             = "us-west-1"
availability_zones = ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]
ops_manager_ami    = "ami-4f291f2f"
rds_instance_count = 1
dns_suffix         = "example.com"

ssl_cert = <<EOF
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
some cert
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
EOF

ssl_private_key = <<EOF
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
some cert private key
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
EOF
```

## Running

Note: please make sure you have created the `terraform.tfvars` file above as mentioned.

### Standing up environment

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out=plan
terraform apply plan
```

### Tearing down environment

```bash
terraform destroy
```
